# Kaleidoscope-Output-Data-Wrangling
This code manages outputs from Kaleidoscope soundscape index analyses that need a little processing to be analysis-ready. This code combines all project outputs into a master dataset, creates a DateTime column for graphical and statistical analyses, and formats data to be ready for graphing.
